# Introduction

Politics, it would appear globally - is in disarray. It hasn’t kept up with the gradual awakening of people. It has been the safe haven for the power hungry, the greedy, and the snakes among us. Of course, this isn’t true for all those involved - but it is an inescapable fact that the system is broken. It’s a special type of broken, however; it’s clearly working for a minority, but it isn’t working for “the rest of us”. Those few who seek to prevent a revolution of ideas are standing in the way of progress.

The solution, I believe, is Modern Democracy. I can’t profess that I know what that looks like exactly. I can only say that it has been stymied, but I think it’s almost ready to be birthed. Experiments will ensue, and attempts will be made to create or apply technology, or stimulate movements and ideas - which tackle the problem.

This, is one such attempt.

It is my hope that my original thoughts and ideas will be treated as open source, and will create a repository herein from which a new political party will emerge. Perhaps more than one.

If, as I hope, I have grabbed your attention sufficiently - follows is the beginnings of my fleshing out the principles of a new Party. Please feel free to contribute.

In particular, my dissatisfaction with the current UK parties brings me to consider what I would really want to vote for. Not tactically, to avoid the “bad guys” but with passion. Something that I could really get behind. Here’s what would be important for my ideal political party.

## Transparency

There is really very little excuse for lacking transparency in the modern age. We have the tools to store and disseminate information cheaply and efficiently. We can communicate, and revise, and collaborate like no time before us.

It is quite possible to involve a vast number of people in the development of campaigns and policy - or for that matter law.

It is also possible to record and track spending to account for every single penny a party uses, or a representative allocates.

My ideal political party would prefer 100% transparency - not merely in accordance with the prevailing law, because it has to - but, because we don’t learn from things we can hide. It would appreciate that we human beings are flawed, and that transparency is a strong suppressor of temptation. It would care to protect the rights of individuals (such as personal address information, or matters of genuine confidentiality) - but, once satisfied that they are cared for - everything else would get published.

## Evidence Based Practice

Evidence doesn’t always point us in the right direction. It can be distorted, misunderstood, and lack depth or broadness. Moreover, we are bombarded by “research” and “experts” which demonstrates little other than regularly fluctuating advice and a patent untrustworthiness.

That said, when done well and with rigour and honesty - research and expertise is the most rational foundation upon which to make complex decisions.

Not flawless, certainly, and as time goes on we find ourselves being corrected and making improvements - but, at any given moment, a decision well made is treated leniently in hindsight.

My ideal political party would include a “devil's advocate” in any decision. It would not only accept criticism, but actively promote and engage it. It would seek out evidence, and ensure that research was used as intended - rather than seek to satisfy its own confirmation bias.

It would take on-board independent advice from non-partisan sources, and listen to experts - and certainly prefer skilled and experienced professionals to build finalised policy.

## Fair Influence

Undue influence can be created by, amongst other things, Conflict of Interest, Lobbying, and Large Donations. A Political Party should act diligently in recusal, or generally to mitigate the impact on decision.

Policy should offer broad benefits to members, constituents, and citizens generally. It should do so regardless of the opportunities for individual benefit.

Power should reside with appropriate stakeholders - that is to say, party members on matters of party activity, or the public where party representatives hold office and take action or make decisions that has impact beyond internal party activity.

Power, generally, should be limited. The liberty of individuals should be protected by creating balance between social good and individual freedoms.

As such on the subject of influence - my ideal political party would:

* Sacrifice its own power for the benefit of the people
* Either not accept, or otherwise remove the influence of large donations
* Mitigate the influence of lobbying by avoiding opportunities to create influence, and by being fully transparent in the case of unavoidable meetings, collaboration, and communication
