# Core

This is a somewhat ambiguous repository of notes, issues, discussions, and miscellany.

Over time, this repository will contain:

- References to other more specific repositories
- Details of how to contribute
- Internal processes of review

While we wait for this repository to mature (and hopefully work together in to that end), please feel free to read the [introduction](/introduction.md), which describes the initial motives and intention of this body of work.

If you're a creative type, you might want to make suggestions on [naming the party](/naming.md) officially.
