# Organisation Policy

Outside of opinion regarding national policy and legislation - all organisations benefit from a well structured and considered set of policies that outline its functions, behaviours, and rules.

Policies should be broad enough to prepare the organisation to be respond in a well prepared manor and comprehensive enough to limit loopholes. Policies should also ensure that intention and background are well enough understood that should some situation occur that isn't outlined in a policy - that the organisation can still respond effectively and in a way that isn't likely to be considered a corruption of its original purpose.
