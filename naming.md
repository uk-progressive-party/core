# Naming

`The UK Progressive Party` is a name chosen to offer a rough and open description of what type of party is likely to come from this endeavour. It is open to debate and eventual change, but like any democratic effort - such tasks need a consensus and a discussion. Neither of which can happen prior to first developing a following.

If you have a better suggestion, or can offer reasons as to why this might not be a suitable name, do please open an issue.

Currently, my preliminary research informs me that there should be no direct issue with formally registering the name with Electoral Commission. I may of course by drastically misinformed, and given that there used to be a party so named in the UK - that might be a blocker.
