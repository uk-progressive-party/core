# Funds

The Trust will maintain a number of distinct funds that are intended to provide resource for specific campaigns - either national, or local.

When a member makes a donation - they are able to select a range of funds that they would like to contribute to. Larger donations may also be made into these funds.

## The General Campaign Fund

Monies collected to this fund are distributed by a proportional party vote - they are then spent in accordance with the campaign's popularity within the party.

Campaigns are submitted for approval prior to the vote.

Only 70% of the total remaining fund will be offered at any funding round. No campaigns will be approved for funding for a later date, resubmission should occur instead.

Campaigns can provide a minimum and a maximum funding threshold. Those campaigns who achieve a proportion allocation of any funding round, but have not reached their minimum threshold do not receive funding. Those monies above the maximum threshold are kept in the general campaign fund for later reallocation.

Excess funds from any General Campaign (those monies outside of thresholds or from ceased campaigns), or from a newly ceased Special Campaign Fund, or monies generally not allocated - are placed in the General Fund.

## Special Campaign Funds

From time to time the Party may seek to fund and undergo campaigns that achieve a specific ends.

For example, the Party wishes to achieve or contribute to the achievement of votes for people aged 16. A special fund is created, whereby this agenda is funded; creating a campaign or various campaigns over time - that donations can be directly applied to.

This special fund can then only be used for such campaigns or activities stated in the Fund’s Objectives. Monies from such Funds can be used to run National Campaigns, or such a fund can accept applications at a local level for ring fenced funding.

If the fund is closed, it is either:

* Given to the General Fund
* Donated to another organisation who is reasonably expected to achieve or work towards the objective set out by the Fund

## Local Campaigning

Grass roots campaigns are an important part of the regular work done by any political party of merit. Beyond large National Campaigns that are funded by the General Fund - there are local issues that require funding.

Generally speaking, the funds already available for running a local group when combined with the time and effort of those local members (and visiting members) - should offer sufficient grass roots resource to run a local campaign.

Each local group should gather to raise local funds by running local events, by finding appropriate sponsorship - that local fund can then be supplemented to by requesting funds from The Trust to boost particularly important local campaigns. These extra funds can come from the Special Campaign fund if the local effort is aligned - such as if there were a Special Campaign Fund set up for helping protect green spaces.

In general, Local Groups have full access to their own monies - but can donate by vote any surplus to other Funds. Any monies remaining from Local Groups that are disbanded, or unable to maintain compliance with rules or guidelines are donated to other funds (ordinarily as outline in a Local Group Vote, or by instruction of any remaining Local Executive).

## Local Branch Creation Fund

Setting up a new Local Group representing the party can take a lot of work and effort - as well as require some resources to achieve in a way that isn't frustratingly exhausting.

Where this fund is able, new Local Groups are provided with additional resources to help them build a stable foundation.

# Party Funds

## Core Fund

Each paid member contributes to a Core Fund which is used by the Campaign Party as it's primary running costs. Only the Campaign Party can apply for these funds, and is able to apply for up to £5.00 per member per year.

## Membership Subsidy Fund

Each paid member who contributes to the Core Fund also contributes £0.50 to a Subsidy Fund that is used to pay for those members who cannot afford a membership. This Fund is an overflow fund which provides the Core Fund Contribution for each member with a valid application.
