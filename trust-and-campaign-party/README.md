# Trust and Campaign party

The party is intended to be composed of two separate legal entities - the Trust and the Campaign Party.

## The Trust

The Trust is responsible for collecting membership contributions and donations, and for administering campaign contributions to the Campaign Party. It is also used an anonymizer - which separates the influence of votes from the influence of funding.

The Trust provides the Campaign Party with a Membership Maintenance Grant. This grant comes in the form of Â£5.00 per member per year, and is ring fenced with respect to its allocated expenditure.

The Membership Maintenance Grant can only spent on the administration of and direct communication with party members.

It can be spent on:

* Newsletters
* Email subscription services
* Direct mail
* Welcome and renewal letters
* Membership cards
* Direct email services

It cannot be spent on:

* Website hosting
* Campaigning - other than updating the membership on the progress or status of campaigning via a newsletter etc
* Party advertising, marketing, or soliciting new members - other than soliciting current members to promote the party via a newsletter etc

## Campaign Party

The Campaign Party is the organisation that we would regularly recognise as the a political party, and would be the organisation that is registered as such.

It will run campaigns on behalf of and in conjunction with its members.

As well as being supported by the Membership Maintenance Grant - it will receive funding to run its campaigns. After an amount of available funds is provided by The Trust, it will be able to claim for the expense of running each of the campaign.

Campaign Funds will be either given in advance of spending, repaid to cover expenditure already created, or payments will be made on the behalf of the campaign - depending on how the trust determines payments should be made.

Advance payments will be offered for work that can only commence from suppliers that need advance payments, as standard The Campaign Party should utilise its own cash-flow in order to make payments. Those payments that are made on behalf of multiple campaign - such as online adversing, or additional web hosting, will be made by The Trust directly and the proportion of that expenditure is then removed from the available campaigns funds.

The Campaign Party would perform much of the administration required to make this a reality - until such time that The Trust is able to sustain its own administration. Until such time, the Campaign Party will collate all those funding requirements for each campaign and submit them appropriately.
