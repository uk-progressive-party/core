# Membership

Acting on the behalf of others is surely the intention behind any political party of merit. So, it goes without saying that how members are engaged, supported, and empowered is one of the most important areas for a political party.

Balancing the need to create resources to use in its representations, and the need to ensure that each member is able to have a fair influence over the direction and outcomes of the organisation - is a priority.

To that end, membership will be structured as follows.

* [Individual Membership](individual-membership)
* [Organisational Membership](organisational-membership)
