# Organisational Membership

## Outline

In order to provide representation to individuals within other organisations - such as unions, or who work for employers that are supportive of the party - it makes sense to have a special type of membership whereby an external organisation can sponsor their own members to become membership of our organisation too.

As a matter of design and structure - this party has no electoral colleges and does not afford any one individual or group more weighting in their vote than any other. So, any external organisation that wishes to support the party must do so whilst acknowledging that no extra influence will be granted to their organisation or leadership. Rather, their influence will come through the combined individual and anonymous voting of their sponsored members.

The party will seek through its policy and process to limit and where possible remove undue influence or conflict of interest - and will seek to remove the right to membership if it is found to be attempting to distort natural democracy.

To that end, if an organisation is willing to subscribe to strict guidelines and limitations - they will be permitted to sponsor members. This may mean that we get very few, or indeed no organisations wanting to sponsor members. As our design is intended to support the notion of individual influence, the party does not consider this an issue.

Organisations are able to make donations directly if they determine that sponsoring members is not suitable.

## Types of Organisational Sponsorship

### Full Sponsorship

Every membership that is sponsored is paid in full including Core Funding, Subsidy Funding, and Campaign Donation.

### Standard Sponsorship

Every membership that is sponsored has the Core Funding and Subsidy Funding provided for - Campaign Donations are expected to be main by the individual members.
